# About me

Let me introduce myself. My name is Taisija Smirnova. I was born on the 11th of November 1994 in Riga, Latvija.

I’m usually emotional and active person. My life is very diverse. I think that I have a charitable nature, because I always help people. I’m usually calm, but sometimes I can lose my temper and become either angry or sad. I like to laugh and joke. I have got a sense of humor. I’m hard-working and ambitious person. I set high goals for myself and I work hard to reach them. I’m sociable, so I have got a lot of friends. I appreciate people’s honesty, frankness and politeness. I don’t like when people are rude and aggressive.

### Hobbies

I have got some hobbies. I’m always very busy but when I’m free I like to read books. I think books help me to continue my education. In my opinion, books are a source of new and useful information. I enjoy reading books about life of famous people.
As for my interests I spend my free time studying English, swimming, riding a bike, hiking in the countryside and surfing the Internet. I also devote 2 or 3 evenings a week to the gym. Sport is my passion!

That’s all I can tell about myself.
